# test-twitter-stream
Test project.

As first step you need to do composer install

For private and frontend need to install npm (npm i)

The work with Twitter Stream happening in console (CLI). Need to execute file php cli/TwitterConsole.php TwitterConsole
Also, the NodeJs should be run for socket works. You can use forever module, or in private path should run node server.js

Good luck!
